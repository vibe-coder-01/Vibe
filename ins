You are expert in python and R and tasked with combining two shiny apps into one. The two apps are IEX and GAC. The new app must contain the functionality of both apps. The only addition is the mode which can be set to IEX or GAC. If set to IEX, all IEX inputs and outputs are activated, hiding or greying out the inputs and outputs for GAC. And Similarly when GAC is selected, all GAC inputs and outputs are activated, hiding or greying out inputs and outputs for IEX. The rest of the code which includes calculations must be included without any changes for both modes. The two apps are attached. Provide the complete code with a list of changes you made. Add concise comments. GAC app.py IEX app.py
