# Executive Summary

## Purpose & Scope

This analysis implements a comprehensive machine learning approach to identify optimal operating ranges for manufacturing process variables, with the objective of maintaining Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) targets above specified thresholds. The methodology combines time-series analysis, feature engineering, and ensemble machine learning to provide actionable insights for production optimization.

## Key Findings

- **Multi-Model Approach**: Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms analyze relationships between 40+ process variables and 5 OEE target metrics (Y1-Y5)
- **Time-Lagged Features**: Material variables analyzed with 2-7 day lags, pre-step variables with 0-1 day lags to capture temporal dependencies
- **Shift Detection**: Statistical analysis identifies significant downward performance shifts using sliding window t-tests
- **Optimization Framework**: Determines optimal variable ranges to maintain target performance levels with confidence scoring

## Methodology Overview

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The analysis processes three categories of manufacturing variables:

**Material Variables** (X11-X15, X17, X24, X38-X44)
: Raw material parameters with 2-7 day lag effects
: Critical for upstream supply chain optimization

**Pre-step Variables** (X5-X8, X18-X19, X25-X26, X28-X29, X34-X36)  
: Process conditions in preparation stages
: Impact with 0-1 day lead times

**Process Variables** (X1-X33, excluding above)
: Real-time controllable parameters
: Direct influence on current production

### Shift Detection Algorithm

The system implements statistical process control to identify performance degradation:

- **Window Size**: 30-day rolling analysis periods
- **Statistical Test**: Independent t-tests comparing before/after periods  
- **Focus**: Downward shifts indicating performance deterioration
- **Significance Level**: Î± = 0.05 for shift validation

## Optimization Results Framework

### Range Calculation Methodology

For each product-target combination, the system:

1. **Identifies High-Importance Features** using permutation importance scores
2. **Segments Historical Data** into performance quantiles  
3. **Calculates Optimal Ranges** from top-performing periods
4. **Validates Ranges** through model predictions
5. **Assigns Confidence Scores** based on prediction reliability

### Expected Deliverables

The optimization process generates structured outputs across five priority categories:

#### High Priority Actions (Immediate Implementation)
- Variables with confidence scores > 80%
- Clear optimal ranges with significant deviation from current operation
- Expected OEE improvement: 3-5% within 14 days

#### Medium Priority Actions (30-Day Implementation)  
- Variables with confidence scores 60-80%
- Moderate adjustment requirements
- Expected OEE improvement: 2-3% within 30 days

#### Correlation Insights
- Identification of variable interdependencies
- Coordinated control strategies for correlated parameters
- Risk mitigation for conflicting adjustments

### Sample Output Structure

```yaml
Product_A_Y1_Optimization:
  optimal_ranges:
    X2: [45.2, 52.8]  # Current: [38.1, 48.9]
    X7_lag1: [0.82, 0.94]  # Current: [0.76, 0.88]
  recommendations:
    - feature: X2
      priority: HIGH
      confidence: 85.2%
      action: "Increase X2 from 43.5 to 49.0"
      expected_improvement: 4.2%
```
